Our current portal is outdated and difficult to navigate, so customers end up calling support for tasks they should be able to do themselves online.",

We're currently using SAML for authentication and would like to continue with that. As for data refresh, store managers need near real-time data for order status, but billing can be updated daily.",

Have you received any specific feedback from store managers about the current portal's usability issues?

We do have brand guidelines I can share, and we'd like the new portal to have a clean, modern look that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Accessibility is also important as some of our managers have visual impairments.",
